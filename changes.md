# Change Log

## [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]

### 1. Created a new header and hero section
- Updated `src/App.js` to include:
  - A header with a temporary centered logo (text: LOGO)
  - Navigation links: Shop, Hire Us, Our Book, Learn
  - Removed any login, search, or location icons
  - A hero section with a large headline, call-to-action button, and a temporary placement image

### 2. Added styles for header and hero section
- Updated `src/App.css` to style the new header and hero section:
  - Centered logo and navigation
  - Clean, minimal look with a soft background gradient
  - Styled hero headline, button, and image

### 3. Updated hero section image
- Replaced the hero image placeholder in `src/App.js` with the newly provided image (`/images/hero-hammock.jpg`).
- Note: The image should be placed in `public/images/hero-hammock.jpg` for correct display.

### 4. Fixed hero image path
- Updated the hero image path in `src/App.js` to `/hero-hammock.jpg` to match the image location in the public folder.

### 5. Hero section background update
- Updated the hero section in `src/App.js` and `src/App.css` to use the image as a CSS background instead of an <img> tag.
- Centered the headline and button over the background image.
- Added a semi-transparent overlay for text readability.
- Removed the separate <img> tag and related styles.

### 6. Fixed hero background image path error
- Moved the hero background image from CSS to an inline style in the <section> element in `src/App.js`.
- Removed the background property from the `.hero` class in `src/App.css` to resolve the image path error.

### 7. Blended header and hero image with gradient, reduced overlay
- Added a white-to-transparent vertical gradient at the top of the hero section to blend the header and hero image.
- Reduced the hero overlay opacity for a crisper, more vivid image.
- Kept the header background white for clarity.

### 8. Added black consultation bar below header
- Added a black bar below the header and above the hero section with the text 'BOOK YOUR FREE 15-MINUTE PHONE CONSULTATION NOW!' as a clickable link.
- Styled the bar to be full width, with centered white text and a hover effect on the link.
